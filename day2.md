### How to Prototype 
* Plan: What do I want my audience to learn?
* Research: Does my visualization demonstrate this?
* Design: Is my visualization *focused* on this?

### How to Test
* Pilot: Use someone representative of audience knowledge and values.
  - Explain the raw data (what each axes and shape represents)
* Measure: Ask the pattern they see in the data.
  - Explain and show the pattern you are trying to demonstrate if it is different.
  - Ask if the desired pattern is hard to *see* and/or hard to *understand*.

### Iterate
* When data is hard to *see*, consider:
  - Changing colors
  - Changing graph type.
  - Introducing labels/annotations.

### Iterate
* When data is hard to *understand*, consider:
  - Summarzing data
  - Faceting data/small multiples
  - Producing more than one visual to demonstrate concept in smaller steps.
