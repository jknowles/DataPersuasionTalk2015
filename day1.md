### Why Persuasion?

Most data presentations are attempting to make an argument. An argument is a statement offering support for a claim. Most often, we're seeking to convince someone to make a decision or to inform them about a problem that requires their attention. As data analysts, this is based on fact.

### Why not storytelling?

Storytelling is about constructing a compelling narrative, but has no need for fact.


### Visualization

> Of all methods for analyzing and communicating statistical
> information, well-designed data graphics are usually the
> simplest and at the same time the most powerful.

Tufte, 1983.

### Visualization Pitfalls

> The lies are systematic and quite predictable, nearly always
> exaggerating the rate of recent change.

Tufte, 1983.
