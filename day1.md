### Why Persuasion?

Most data presentations are attempting to make an argument. An argument is a statement offering support for a claim. Most often, we're seeking to convince someone to make a decision or to inform them about a problem that requires their attention. As data analysts, this is based on fact.

### Why not storytelling?

Storytelling is about constructing a compelling narrative, but has no need for fact.

Storytelling invites alternatives with no way to equate them.

Storytelling implies an ending, resolution, or moral and does not require the audience to join the action.

Persuasion and argument set the ground rules, define the comparisons, and focus the audience.

### Visualization

> Of all methods for analyzing and communicating statistical
> information, well-designed data graphics are usually the
> simplest and at the same time the most powerful.

Tufte, 1983.

### Visualization Pitfalls

> The lies are systematic and quite predictable, nearly always
> exaggerating the rate of recent change.

Tufte, 1983.
